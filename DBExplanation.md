### 1. **User and Question Relationship (One-to-Many)**
A single user can ask many questions, but each question is asked by one user.

```
   +-------------+           +-----------------+
   |   User      | 1       M |    Question     |
   +-------------+<--------->+-----------------+

   | email       |           | body            |
   +-------------+           | user_id (FK)    |
                              +-----------------+
```

- **Diagram Explanation:**
  - The `User` entity has a one-to-many relationship with the `Question` entity.
  - The foreign key `user_id` in the `Question` table refers back to the `id` in the `User` table.

### 2. **User and Answer Relationship (One-to-Many)**
